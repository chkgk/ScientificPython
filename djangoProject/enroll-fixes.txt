# bugs to fix in enroll app

"enroll/templates/layout.html" needs to be fixed to use the enroll namespace:
--> <a href="{% url 'enroll:enroll' %}" class="ui green button">Enroll</a>



# Further steps necessary to make it run:
- include enroll/settings.py in main project settings.py 
- add include for enroll/urls.py to main prokect urls.py, don't forget to add the namespace
- provide valid email server credentials in enroll/settings.py
